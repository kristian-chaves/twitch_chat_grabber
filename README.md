# twitch_chat_grabber

i tried making a twitch chat grabber, ngl i was sorta tipsy while coding like half of this but from what i remember 
  - run one of the files (probs main.js?) concurrently with main.py
    - i meant to code this to automatically code concurrently but i think i fell asleep
  - it grabs inputs from a channel (boxbox is the default i think), and i think the python wordle file runs with like a seconds delay
    - every n seconds it hashes a bunch of inputs, checks if its a valid word length, and if so, runs it as a valid word
      - if it does not do this, mb whoops
    - if chat correctly guesses the word within allotted guesses, chat wins!
      - if not, L
i recognize a lot of the uncertainty of this readme and this repository could be removed by me just removing the unnecessary files and reading through my code once, but i have convinced myself that if i do that the terrorists win
